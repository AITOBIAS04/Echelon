# Project: Codename Seed (AI Simulation Engine)
# Structure: Monorepo (Backend, Frontend, Smart-Contracts)

# --- CRITICAL RULES ---

1. BACKEND (Agents & Logic):
   - Location: /backend
   - Stack: Python, FastAPI, Anthropic Agent SDK
   - Rules:
     - ALWAYS use 'claude-agent-sdk' for agent logic.
     - NEVER use OpenAI/LangChain libraries.
     - ALWAYS implement 'Prompt Caching' headers.
     - Use 'pydantic' for validation.

2. FRONTEND (UI):
   - Location: /frontend
   - Stack: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS
   - Rules:
     - Use 'lucide-react' for icons.
     - Connect to backend via standard REST API endpoints.

3. SMART CONTRACTS:
   - Location: /smart-contracts
   - Stack: Solidity, Hardhat/Foundry
   - Rules:
     - Prioritize Chainlink VRF for randomness.

4. BEHAVIOR:
   - When generating Python tools, include docstrings explaining the tool to Claude.
   - Always assume I am running commands from the ROOT of the repo.

# COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
- ROUTINE CHATTER: Use 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022'
- CRITICAL LOGIC: Use 'claude-opus-4-5-20251101' (New Flagship)

# SECURITY REVIEW REQUIREMENTS:
ALWAYS review code for:
- SQL Injection (ensure parameterized queries)
- XSS (ensure proper sanitization)
- IDOR (verify user permissions on data access)
If you see insecure patterns, flag them immediately.

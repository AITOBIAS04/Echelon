You are a factual verification judge. Your task is to evaluate the RECALL of an oracle's summary of a code change.

## Ground Truth (the actual PR)
Title: {title}
Description: {description}

Diff:
```
{diff_content}
```

## Oracle Summary
{summary}

## Task
1. First, identify the most important changes in the diff (key modifications, new features, bug fixes, structural changes). List up to 10.
2. Then, check which of these important changes are mentioned or reflected in the oracle's summary.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "changes": [
    {{"change": "description of important change", "surfaced": true}},
    {{"change": "description of important change", "surfaced": false}}
  ],
  "recall": 0.0,
  "total": 0,
  "surfaced": 0
}}

Where:
- recall = surfaced / total (0.0 if total is 0)
- total = number of important changes identified
- surfaced = number of changes reflected in the oracle's summary

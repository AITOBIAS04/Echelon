You are a factual verification judge. Your task is to evaluate the PRECISION of an oracle's summary of a code change.

## Ground Truth (the actual PR)
Title: {title}
Description: {description}

Diff:
```
{diff_content}
```

## Oracle Claims
The oracle made the following claims about this PR:
{claims_json}

## Task
For each claim, determine if it is SUPPORTED by the actual diff content. A claim is supported if the diff provides evidence for it. A claim is unsupported if it describes changes not present in the diff or fabricates details.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "claims": [
    {{"claim": "the claim text", "supported": true, "evidence": "brief evidence from diff"}},
    {{"claim": "the claim text", "supported": false, "evidence": null}}
  ],
  "precision": 0.0,
  "total": 0,
  "supported": 0
}}

Where:
- precision = supported / total (0.0 if total is 0)
- total = number of claims evaluated
- supported = number of claims with evidence in the diff

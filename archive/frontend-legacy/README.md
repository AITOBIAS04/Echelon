# Frontend Legacy (Next.js)

This is the **legacy Next.js frontend** that has been superseded by the Vite-based frontend.

## Status: Archived

This frontend is no longer actively maintained. The canonical frontend is now `/frontend` (Vite + React + TypeScript).

## Why Archived

- Migration to Vite for faster dev experience and simpler build pipeline
- TypeScript migration for better type safety
- Unified component architecture with modern React patterns

## If You Need This Code

The code is preserved here for reference. If you need to run it:

```bash
cd archive/frontend-legacy
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note:** This frontend may have outdated dependencies and is not recommended for new development.

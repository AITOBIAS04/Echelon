# Engineer Feedback — Sprint 31 (Cycle-033 Sprint 2)

**Reviewer**: Senior Technical Lead
**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Verdict**: All good

## Summary

Clean implementation. All acceptance criteria met. 427 tests pass with zero regressions. Code follows the established observer theatre pattern exactly. Template normalization approach is well-reasoned.

## Minor Items (non-blocking)

1. **Unused import** — `scripts/run_two_rail_theatres.py:31`: `from theatre.engine.canonical_json import canonical_json` is imported but never used. Remove it.

## Approval

All good.
